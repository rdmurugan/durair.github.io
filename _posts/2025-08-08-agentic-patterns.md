Leaders don’t need more demos—they need patterns that **survive production**.

**Three to start:**
1. **Retrieval-first RAG** with task-specific indices and eval gates.
2. **Tool-using agents** with explicit safety rails and timeouts.
3. **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints** tied to risk thresholds and SLAs.

I’ll expand on eval harnesses, observability, and governance in follow-ups.
